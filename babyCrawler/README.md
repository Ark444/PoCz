Baby crawler
====

This baby crawler folder contains just some PoC of crawlers

babyCrawler.py will list all the different urls availables
        I think it could be optimized, but I don't know how for now, and I don't know how the "in" keyword of python is implemented

sortRefs.py will do the same thing as babyCrawler, but will sort the resulting list and provide you the top10 of the most 'refered to' websites.
